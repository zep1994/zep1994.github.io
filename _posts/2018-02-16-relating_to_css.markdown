Css is one of my favorite parts to the world of web development. A color palette to a canvas. This also similar to life.  Could you image the world without color or spacing. Buses are already bad enough. CSS allows you make a basic website with just text and add whatever you want to it. Again, this is like life, because is the order in which we do things is important. Priority becomes a huge factor when dealing with where to put to put things, but also not everyone would have the same design choice of colors or spacing. What you do first be could be affected by things you do later on. This is the cascading affect and it can either help or hurt you depending on how you use it. 

This has related to how I have been learning code and how I plan to contiue coding. I plan to learn the basics, like the background and spacing of my coding career, then further down the line, add more complex colors and spacing to get that beautiful website that is my coding canvas.
