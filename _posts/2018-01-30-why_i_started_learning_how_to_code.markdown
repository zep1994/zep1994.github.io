My name is Thomas Matlock. I am student at the University of Mississippi. My major is management, which at the time was the closest thing I could find to Entrepreneurship. I have a passion to think of new ideas and create them. AI and robotics are about to change the ways we work and the jobs we know today will not exist, because they have been replaced with new jobs. People will need to be more creative and capable of solving things in new ways. They will have the ability to when many tasks will become automated. Coding is one of those creative task I wish to learn to start building products with teammates. Coding often requires team to be extremely collaborative and can often challenge a whole team. It is this reason, I want to be able to assist my teammates and understand them if they try to assist me. 

Understanding how to solve a problem can be a big step. One even bigger when working on it by yourself. You need a team of good company. It is not an easy road finding those people, but the more I knowledge I arm myself with, the more likely I will be to run accross those team members who feel similar to me about what we can do to make something that postively changes people's day.

I remember not being able to find a team for a project a while ago and thought, "What app could I get on to find other like minded people?" Well I ended up posting to Facebook to no avail. I thought Facebook was the social media king and I could not find anyone trustworthy to talk about possibly working with? This sparked a lightbulb in my brain. There is SO much stuff that has yet to be coded. With that thought, I starting learning as much as I could about building basic to more complex websites involving things like PHP, JSON and AJAX. After working on my own for a while, I did not have the confidence to say this is what I am working on. That is why I am here to coding learning how to code. The more knowledge, the more confidence in the workplace and better results in the long run.
