As my college career comes to an end, I am stepping into the workforce. I will always be searching for to gather innnovative minds to brng about change. College and I have not always gotten along. When you start at a 100 and everything hurts you does not seem like a very creative environment. I love Flatiron and want to talk about this all day. This, I hope is only the beginning of a long and enriching career in the tech field.
