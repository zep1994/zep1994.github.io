This has been one crazy month. With graduation this month I have had a lot going on. My parents really wanted me to walk which I was not so fond of. College has been a lot and so today when I got back from a long break I took I realized I had taken about a week longer of rest than I expected. I couldn't believe it, but it's time to start back. 

The CLI was a big lab for me, because I began to see how the communication between objects took place. This really helped me remember how to use @@all properly. It has been a lot of fun diving into this. I remember a moment when working on this that needed to adjust the itteration I had over the data I was creating an object out of. I first needed to use collect and create a new instance of the object. I looked over all the material I could, but the biggest help was meeting with the instuctors in a one on one meeting. I still have one more meeting to do before I can wrap this up, but I have completed enough to finish my blog. 

The biggest challenge for me was getting the scraping down. It took some time to understand how I can view data. Depending on the situation the way you set things up can vary. I did my project on tech events that are happening. I finally got the menu complete, which was great to see how easy a menu for a cli can be once you pratice it. I then had the challenge of diving into data by one layer. This was my last challenge which took me some time to think on. 

The next biggest challenge was really getting my instance variables down. I had small things that I could not quite remember, but I know with some pratice I will be able to make sure I know this subject.
