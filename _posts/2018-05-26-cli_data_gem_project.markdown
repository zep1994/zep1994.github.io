This has been one crazy month. With graduation this month I have had a lot going on. My parents really wanted me to walk which I was not so fond of. College has been a lot and so today when I got back from a long break I took I realized I had taken about a week longer of rest than I expected. I couldn't believe it, but it's time to start back. 

The CLI was a big lab for me, because I began to see how the communication between objects took place. This really helped me remember how to use @@all properly. It has been a lot of fun diving into this. I remember a moment when working on this that needed to adjust the itteration I had over the data I was creating an object out of. I first needed to use collect and create a new instance of the object. I looked over all the material I could, but the biggest help was meeting with the instuctors in a one on one meeting. I still have one more meeting to do before I can wrap this up, but I have completed enough to finish my blog. 

The biggest challenge for me was getting the scraping down. It took some time to understand how I can view data. Depending on the situation the way you set things up can vary. I did my project on tech events that are happening. I finally got the menu complete, which was great to see how easy a menu for a cli can be once you pratice it. I then had the challenge of diving into data by one layer. This was my last challenge which took me some time to think on. 

While working on this project, I ran into an intersting problem that I thought was an interesting solution. In my method I used to scrape the data from the website was receiving a 404 error. Then I used binding pry to see what the console could show me about what was going on. I then went and looked at my code and noticed I had two methods that where getting the url. I meant for each method to do something different, one covering the titles of the conferences, the other covering the description of the data. The problem with this is that I was getting two URLs when I was scraping for the description, but not the tech titles. I then removed the method that contained one extra part that was different, the URL had /event/ added to it. This was so cool to see in binding pry and credit to David from Flatiron for helping me out with binding pry. Before this project I had been uncomfortable with several things, such as Github and binding pry, but by the end of this I felt much more ready to start using these tools more often. 

I overall loved this project even though it has taken me forever to get caught up with everything. This really helped push me and showed me many instances where I found holes in my knowledge and helped me fix them.
